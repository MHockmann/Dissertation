## Information 
The file *Measure-trigo-approximations-main* contains a variant of the calculations originally made by Paul Catala, 
see [https://github.com/Paulcat/Measure-trigo-approximations/tree/main](https://github.com/Paulcat/Measure-trigo-approximations/tree/main). 
Run *ExampleProxy.m* to obtain the calculations stored in *results* or execute *Plotting_W1_rates.m* in order to generate the figure included in my thesis.
