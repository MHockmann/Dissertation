# Dissertation - Sparse super resolution 

In this project, you can find the code related to my PhD thesis on "Sparse super resolution in microscopy: Condition, diffraction limit and trigonometric approximations" which I will hand in in the next weeks. 
The code written in MATLAB is ordered by the chapters of the dissertation. 

## Content

### Introduction
  Here, you can find code for the figures about the diffraction limits in the introduction. 

### Chapter 1: Preliminaries
This folder contains some code used to produce figures of minorant functions.
  
### Chapter 2: Condition of sparse super resolution
   Code for the visualisation of the bivariate diffraction limit and of the proposed admissible functions can be found there.
   
### Chapter 3: Trigonometric polynomials and rational functions
   1. Variant of the experiment from a [paper together with P. Catala, S. Kunis and M. Wageringel](https://github.com/Paulcat/Measure-trigo-approximations) which is available as a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10531v2). 
   2. Experiment on the performance of the Christoffel function for noisy data

### Chapter 4: Applications in microscopy
   1. STORM analysis of a data set from the [EFPL challenge 2016](https://srm.epfl.ch/Challenge/ChallengeSimulatedData) using our approach with Christoffel functions
   2. Simulation of our algorithms for SIM in the setting of SMLM

## Usage

Just run the included scripts in MATLAB.
